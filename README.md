**PongLove**

Overview
Welcome to Pong Love, a project I developed during my time at a Code Club as part of my civic service at Unis-Cité Nîmes. The Code Club is dedicated to teaching programming fundamentals to children aged 6 to 12. This project introduces them to the classic game of Pong, offering an engaging way to learn and apply programming concepts.
